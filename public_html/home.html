            HTML Pages
        </h1>
        <p>
            You will find these pages in the repository under <code>public_html</code>.
            Notice that I put each section in a different file and used two
            javascript functions in 
            <code>util.js</code> to show or hide each section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The repository contains these HTML pages.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            The header
        </h2>
        <p>
            You will find this and the menu bar in <code>menu.html</code>
        </p>
        <h2>
            The body
        </h2>
        <p>
            These pages display below the menu and above the footer.  Using my
            method, you must add each new page to the <code>menu.html</code>
            <i>and</i> to <code>index.html</code>, using <code>util.js</code> 
            to show or hide the page content as required.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>home.html</code> is the home page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>page2.html</code> is page 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>page3.html</code> you've probably figured my naming convention
            by now.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The footer
        </h2>
        <p>
            <code>footer.html</code> contains my homemade footer, and it holds
            an example of what you should add to your primary wiki page.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Netbeans
        </h2>
        <p>
            I used Netbeans to create and edit my repository because the interface
            is easy to figure out, it works well with git, and it has a Chrome
            plugin that auto-updates when you make a change to the CSS. 
            I still make a habit of pushing "play" button, though,
            to ensure that I save everything before refreshing Chrome.

    <li id="group-projects-col-2" class="column-child">

        <p>This is <code>&lt;div id="group-projects-col-2" class="column-child"&gt;</code>.</p>

        <h1>
            Home-made CSS
        </h1>
        <p>
            This page is pretty ugly because it is CSS that I made.  I just want
            to show you that it is possible to make your own, too.  The menu is 
            from the 
            <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/">
                Dynamic Drive CSS Library</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>Be sure to
            use a unique name for your classes and id's, or it will conflict
            with the project management (PM) server CSS.  To be frank, you will
            probably face this problem of "dueling CSS's," but just try to work
            around it.  This should only be a minor inconvenience if you use unique
            names for your own CSS.
        </p>
        <p>You may find it interesting that I used an ordered list 
            to create this 3-column main section.  Try resizing your 
            window height and width to see how well this works.  You will
            find the CSS for this in <code>group-projects.css</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>
            @media <i>print</i>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Please add CSS to print your work.  I created a simple 
            <span style="font-family: courier;"><strong>@media print</strong></span>
            in <code>group-projects.css</code> as an example.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Other CSS Options
        </h2>
        <p>
            Bootstrap is prettier, and I used it on pages 2 and 3.
            There are other options available, too. 
            You can also use it to easily create a menu, as well.
        </p>

    </li>

    <!-- COLUMN 3 -->
    <li id="group-projects-col-3" class="column-child">

        <p>This is <code>&lt;div id="group-projects-col-3" class="column-child"&gt;</code>.</p>

        <h1>In the Wiki Editor</h1>

        <p>
            You only need to place the code I wrote in the footer into your wiki 
            main page for this method to work, but write your own project name
            instead of <strong><i>cs371_group_projects</i></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Notice that each page does not 
            have a unique URL, which affects search engine optimization (SEO).  
            I am not worried about this because our projects are only for practice
            and group assignment grading, but feel free to make separate wiki pages
            if you want your pages to be directly navigable.
        </p>

        <h2>Using Git</h2>

        <p>
            In Netbeans, if you look under the <strong><i>Team</i></strong> menu, 
            you will find all of the Git controls.  After setting it up, you 
            pretty much only need:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100px;"><strong>Team</strong></p>

        <ul style="padding-left: 130px;">
            <li>
                Add
            </li>
            <li>
                Commit
            </li>
            <li>
                Remote
                <ul>
                    <li>Fetch</li>
                    <li>Pull</li>
                    <li>Push</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>First, create a generic layout and push it to your repository because
            it may look slightly different on the PM server
            than on your local system. After
            that, you only need to push it to the PM server
            when it looks good on your local system, not after every change you 
            make.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, Netbeans seems to only commit files that you have selected,
            so be sure to select the parent folder, such as "Site Root" or the
            project folder, when committing multiple files.
        </p>
