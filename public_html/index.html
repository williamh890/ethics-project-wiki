        <hr />
        <p> Good ideas don't come free. This page describes the brainstorming process that lead to the conceptual creation of StubyBudy. It's all about finding a way to get the best ideas as possible. Our development group went through several stages of generating and then sorting ideas to come up with the best possible ideas for our concept. </p>
        <h2 class="display-3"> Group Passing </h2>
          <hr />
            <p>
              In this step each member of the development group wrote down a possible project idea. Then these idease were passed around and expanded upon by each member of the group. After two cycles of this we had generated all the inital ideas we needed, coming in at a grand total of 50 ideas!

              </figure>

              <p>
                After resting on our ideas, we came back the next day and decieded on one of the project ideas to further elaborated on. Instead of cycling through, we took a more free and focused approach and just jotted down any item we could think of for any that one idea. Once we had exhastivly fleshed our chosen concept, it was time to move onto the next phase of the brainstorm -- sorting. And we all know how much computer scientists love sorting!

        <h2 class="display-3"> Affinity Diagram </h2>

          <figure class="figure image-box-left">
            <img src="images/affinity.JPG"

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            With this random jumble of ideas we had just created, we needed to find some way of making sense of it all. This is where affinity diagraming cam to our rescue. Taking all the ideas that had just been generated, we went about trying to catagorize them in some logical order. Starting out, all the categories were very general just to get an initial feel for the groupings. As the categorizing continued, more obvious patterns started to emergue and the structure of our application started to appear.

            </figure>
            <p>
              The last step befor ranking our ideas was too take a step back and look at the bigger picture of our prespective project. Who were the people and organizations who would be interested and affected by the application? To answer this we made a bull's-eye diagram dipicting all the different parties that would be involved by our concept.
