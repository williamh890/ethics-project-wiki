        <h2 >Introduction</h2>

        <hr />

        <p> Good ideas don't come free and this page describes the brainstorming process that led to the conceptual creation of StubyBudy.
		It's all about finding a way to get the best ideas possible. Our development group went through several stages of generating and then
		sorting ideas to come up with the best possible ideas for our concept. </p>

        <h4 >Overview</h4>

        <p> We began our brainstorming session with each member of the group writing their project ideas on a post it note. Once each member chose
		an idea, we performed the group passing phase, where we passed the ideas on the post it notes around to each group member who added an additional
		idea to the main one. After several rounds of group passing, we performed the post-up phase, where we silently added more ideas to the main idea.
		Next, we silently sorted the ideas we had come up with into different categories, creating the affinity diagram. We then moved on to the bullâ€™s-eye diagram
		where we determined our direct and indirect stakeholders, as well as the wider environment that will be affected by our product. Finally, we completed
		the forced ranking phase, where we ranked the ideas we came up with based on different categories and perspectives.

        </p>

        <h2 > Group Passing </h2>

          <hr />

            <p>

			      In this step each member of the development group wrote down a possible project idea. Then these ideas were
			  passed around and expanded upon by each member of the group. After two cycles of this we had generated all
			  the initial ideas we needed, coming in at a grand total of 50 ideas! And never say any idea is a bad idea during this phase! No buts.

            </p>

          <h2 > Post-Up </h2>

            <hr />

            <div class="step-block">

              <figure class="figure image-box-right">

                <img src="images/post.JPG"

                     class="figure-img rounded"

                     alt="postup diagram">

                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">

                </figcaption>

              </figure>

              <p>

					After resting on our ideas, we came back the next day and picked out certain parts of our app to 
				further elaborate on. Instead of cycling through, we now took a more free and focused approach and just jotted
				down any new idea we could think of. Once we had exhaustively fleshed out our chosen
				concept, it was time to move onto the next phase of the brainstorming session -- sorting. And we all know how much
				computer scientists love sorting! (Bubble sort being an exception of course)

              </p>

        <h2 > Affinity Diagram </h2>

        <hr />

        <div class="step-block">

          <figure class="figure image-box-left">

            <img src="images/affinity.JPG"

                 class="figure-img rounded"

                 alt="postup diagram">

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">

              Ideas being grouped in a logical fashion.

            </figcaption>

          </figure>

          <p>

				Now that we had this random jumble of ideas, we needed to find some way of making sense of it all! This
			is where affinity diagramming came to our rescue. Taking all the ideas that we had just been generated, we went about trying to
			categorize them in some logical order. Starting out, all the categories were very general just to get an initial feel for the
			groupings. As the categorizing continued, more obvious patterns started to emerge and the structure of our application started
			to appear.

        <h2 > Bull's-eye Diagram </h2>

              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">

                Bull-eye diagram depicting parties involved.

              </figcaption>

            </figure>

            <p>

				The last step before ranking our ideas was to take a step back and look at the bigger picture of our
			  prospective project. Who were the people and organizations who would be interested and affected by the
			  application? To answer this we made a bull's-eye diagram depicting all the different parties that would
			  be affected by our concept.
